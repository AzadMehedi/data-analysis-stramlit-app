# Automatic Statistical Data Analysis Application
I have developed an "Automatic Statistical Data Analysis Application" using Python, Statistics, and Streamlit.  Users can upload their datasets into the app. Once a dataset is provided, the application automatically performs a statistical analysis and provides insights.  

It detects inappropriate values, missing values, duplicate entries, and other issues in the dataset & treatment accordingly. Users can explore and analyze the data using various filtering options as per their needs.  

Additionally, users can generate Univariate, Bivariate, Pair Plots, Heatmaps, and other visualizations as required. Finally, the application allows users to generate a **statistical report** along with the cleaned dataset and download it.

 >>Execution Approach:

1. Data Upload & Preprocessing:
Implemented a file upload feature to accept Excel & CSV files.
Used various statistical methods & Pandas to clean inappropriate & missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess categorical & numerical data.

2. Statistical Analysis & Visualization:
Generated univariate and bivariate analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly etc.
Created interactive plots according to features types (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, pie plots, bar plots, heatmaps, etc.) to explore & relationships between variables.

3. User Interaction & Report Generation:
Provided dynamic filtering options for better insights.
Enabled users to download cleaned datasets and reports with insights.

Result:
- The application helped non-technical users explore datasets without coding.
- Reduced manual data cleaning efforts 80% in the app, improving efficiency.
- Users could download cleaned datasets and statistical reports, making data-driven decisions faster.

  # Lets see some captures

  Here we can see a file uploader option. We can either drug & drop or browse the file. It can take Excel or csv file.
  For demonstration purpose i browse & upload a dataset called hachathon.csv which is 11.7 MB.

  Here we can use a checkbox to show up the dataset or show off uncheck it.

  By this Filterable Checkmark we can show the dataset which we can apply filtering to see the changes in real time.
